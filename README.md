Python Twitter data collector built on [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) that allow users to dynamically 
collect accounts and statuses from Twitter during streaming, and automatically generate Datasets from collected data
that you can as CSV.

This library provides a framework that you can use to build your own data collector, specifying which are your features
that have to be extracted from Twitter accounts/statuses.

Creating your Twitter dataset:
1. Instantiate an `AccountCollector` and/or `StatusCollector` class in according to what you want collect, accounts, statuses or both.
At this step you can re-defined your own features that have to be extracted from twitter data, you have to pass dict-like parameters in the following form: <feature_name, function> where the function has to be applied to the user or status object.
Please refer to [documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/user-object.html) for more details about Twitter objects
2. Instantiate the `OnlineStreamer` passing the collector as parameter 
3. Start streaming on some topics
4. Save the created dataset at specified location

NB: It is not mandatory to use both collectors and streamer but you can also use Collectors alone, for instance if you already have the users and/or statuses to collect and you don't need to stream anything.


***NEW FEATURES:***
* *Offline collection by name*, allow user to make a query by name and collect some name-similar users extracting features defined in the collector constructor

## INSTALLATION

The package is available on PyPi [here](https://pypi.org/project/ptdc/)

```bash
$ pip install ptdc
```

## EXAMPLE USAGE
### Import modules
```
from ptdc import authenticate, AccountCollector, OnlineStreamer, StatusCollector
```
### Define tokens
Replace the following tokens with yours, see Twitter developers [authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens.html) for more details about how obtain them.
```    
consumer_key = "xxxxxxxxxxx"
consumer_key_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
access_token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
access_token_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```    
### Create the default Tweepy API object of tweepy

```
api = authenticate(consumer_key=consumer_key, consumer_key_secret=consumer_key_secret, access_token=access_token, access_token_secret=access_token_secret)
```                       

### Create your own Collectors for collecting data
Create your own StatusCollector object

```
s_collector = StatusCollector(api=api)
```    

Create your own AccountCollector object, which will collect also statuses 
```
collector = AccountCollector(api=api, statuses_collector=s_collector)
```
### Create the Streamer
Create Online Streamer that will collect data (in this case will collect only 5 accounts)
```
streamer = OnlineStreamer(api=api, collector=collector, data_limit=5, n_statuses=400)
```
### Start streaming
You can start streaming in all ways defined by Tweepy, see its doc for more details
```
streamer.stream(track=['famous', 'web', 'vip', 'holiday', 'pic', 'photo'], is_async=False)
```
### Save dataset/s
After streaming ended (in according to your defined limits), save DataFrame/s generated into csv file/s.
You just need to access the collector object and call the save_dataset method providing the path.
```
streamer.collector.save_dataset(path="../data/accounts.csv")
```
